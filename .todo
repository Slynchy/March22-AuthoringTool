Backlog:
    Bugs:    
        ☐ Multiple single-destination function nodes cause entire tree to be hidden when hiding function nodes
        ☐ Opening the edit node modal wipes the existing parameters
        ☐ Functions that end in a boolean have the boolean appended even if it is an optional parameter or breaks the function
        ☐ The 'Script File' option is now deprecated and needs to be removed
            ☐ Change mouse-over title of nodes from script filename to something else
        ☐ Weird interaction when changing level of a node
    Features:
        ☐ Preview system
        ✔ New nodes go to the highest level by default
        ☐ Settings button/modal
            ☐ Make VisJS styling configurable
        ☐ Generic loading modal to show when busy with async operations
        ☐ Localisation
            ☐ Unicode-friendly font
            ☐ New JS file to house all strings and localisations
            ☐ Make existing frontend utilize said JS file
