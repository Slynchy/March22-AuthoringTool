Completed:
    Bugs:
        ✘ Weird interaction when changing level of a node (have made better, but can't really fix)
        ✔ Opening the edit node modal wipes the existing parameters
        ✔ The 'Script File' option is now deprecated and needs to be removed
            ✔ Change mouse-over title of nodes from script filename to something else
        ✔ Functions that end in a boolean have the boolean appended even if it is an optional parameter or breaks the function
        ✔ Multiple single-destination function nodes cause entire tree to be hidden when hiding function nodes
            ✔ Need to also adjust the node levels to account for missing nodes
        ✔ Script compilation is producing unordered scripts, which would be fine but the starting node is not correct either

    Features:
        ✔ New nodes go to the highest level by default
        ✔ Settings button/modal
            ✔ Make VisJS styling configurable
            ✔ Add settings to project saving/loading
            ✔ Update the modal with set settings
